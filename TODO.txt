  * [DONE] Jabber bot
  * Evented jabber bot
  * Empty periodic event loop
  * Empty periodic loop (non-evented)
  * Queue (SQS, AMQP, etc) pollers

* Support for dropping privileges
* Support for chroot'ing
* Improved and cleaned up logging
* Plenty of docs, seriously a lot of docs
* Specs & features, tons of them too
* Some level of thread safety, or mechanisms to ease thread safety
